# Rust High Performance
This is the code repository for [Rust High Performance](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rust-high-performance?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788399487), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Sometimes it's difficult to get the best performance out of Rust. This book teaches you how to optimize the speed of your Rust code to the level of languages such as C/C++. You'll understand and fix common pitfalls, learn how to improve your productivity by using metaprogramming, and speed up your code by concurrently executing parts of it safely and easily. Master the features of the language that make it stand out and use them to really improve the efficiency of your algorithms.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders. Chapter05 do not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
for row in arr1.iter().cartesian_product(arr2.iter()) {
  print!("{:?}, ", row);
}
```

This book assumes some basic knowledge of the Rust programming language. If you are new to Rust, the first few chapters of the official Rust book are a great prelude. Nevertheless, you should have moderate to deep knowledge of at least one programming language; basic knowledge of terminal usage will also be needed.

Having basic knowledge of computer architectures is a plus, along with basic knowledge of high-performance programming in C/C++. They are not required, though, since in this book we will cover all the base theory to understand how the performance improvements work behind the scenes.

You will need a code editor or an IDE to follow the book. Rust has been heavily tested in Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, GitHub's Atom, and IntelliJ's IDEA IDE. I have personally used Atom to write the code examples, but feel free to use your favorite text editor or IDE. You will probably find plugins or extensions for your editor.

In the case of VS Code, Atom, and IntelliJ IDEA, you will find official Rust packages along with unofficial extensions. Personally, I've been using the Tokamak package for Atom
